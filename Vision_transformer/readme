Developed a Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch for sequence prediction of non-interacting spherical particles in a box. This model processes input frames by dividing them into patches and uses a class token from the encoder's output to predict the next frame. Successfully achieved accurate predictions up to 1 frame ahead, demonstrating the ViT's effectiveness in modeling particle dynamics.
